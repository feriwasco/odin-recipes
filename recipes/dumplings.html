            <li>Stir together flour, baking powder, sugar, and salt in a 
                bowl. Cut in butter until mixture is crumbly. Stir in milk 
                and mix until a batter forms that is thick enough to be 
                scooped with a spoon. Allow batter to rest for 3 to 5 
                minutes.</li>
            <li>Drop batter by spoonfuls into boiling stew or soup. Cover
                 and simmer without lifting the lid for 15 minutes.
